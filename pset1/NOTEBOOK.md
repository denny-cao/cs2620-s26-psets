# Lab notebook

Consider using this file to track the results of your performance experiments.
For each important commit, including the handout, record (1) the commit hash,
(2) a description of the commit (e.g., any changes you made), (3) the
environment you ran the code, and (4) a snapshot of overall RPC performance,
plus any thoughts.
